# Task3
# Check Number: Positive/Negative and Even/Odd

This Dart program checks whether a given number is positive, negative, or zero and whether it is even or odd.

## Features
- Takes a hard-coded number to check.
- Uses simple `if-else` conditions to determine:
  - If the number is **positive**, **negative**, or **zero**.
  - If the number is **even** or **odd**.

## Code Explanation
1. **Positive/Negative/Zero Check**: 
   - The program checks if the number is greater than 0, less than 0, or equal to 0 to determine if it's positive, negative, or zero.
   
2. **Even/Odd Check**: 
   - The program uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the number is divisible by 2 (even) or not (odd).

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Dart file (`Task3.dart`) and run it in your Dart environment.

## Example Output:

For a positive number:
7 is Positive 7 is Odd

For a negative number:
-4 is Negative -4 is Even

For zero:
0 is Zero 0 is Even
